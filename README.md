# Insight project

#### Tools: Seaborn, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly (Dash)

This is the project I worked on at Insight Data Science NY in Fall 2019. This project came from a collaboration with a 
mobile game studio, that developed an interactive trivia game following a TV game show format. The objective was to 
understand the important game features that drive users to make in-app purchases. A follow-up objective of mine was to 
predict the number of in-app purchases and design a sequence of questions that would yield a larger number of in-app purchases.

### Data
The data was provided by the company. It was queried from Google BigQuery using SQL, and included tables on the questions' 
features, show features, and statistics on the answers at each question.
